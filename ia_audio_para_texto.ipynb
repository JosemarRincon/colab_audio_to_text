        "*   **Mentalidade de \"Proprietário\":** Não espere pelo \"tempo de estudo\". Faça do inglês parte de todos os momentos do seu dia (caminhando, pensando, cozinhando, sonhando).\n",
        "*   **Abrace os Erros:** Erros significam crescimento. Se você não está cometendo erros, não está aprendendo.\n",
        "*   **Consistência é Chave:** O tempo não é seu professor, a consistência é. Tenha \"dias sem zero inglês\", mesmo que seja apenas dizer três frases para si mesmo, assistir a um vídeo curto e repetir uma linha, ou escrever um pequeno parágrafo.\n",
        "*   **Inglês é uma Habilidade, Não uma Matéria:** Habilidades crescem com ação diária, não apenas estudo.\n",
        "*   **Você é Seu Primeiro Parceiro de Inglês:** Não espere por um parceiro de conversação ideal. Falar sozinho é a melhor maneira de praticar sem medo de julgamento.\n",
        "*   **Benefícios de Falar Sozinho:** Constrói fluência, confiança, memória muscular, pensamento automático (parando de traduzir) e velocidade na fala.\n",
